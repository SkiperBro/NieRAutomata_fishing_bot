## Installing dependencies for the bot

The following components are required for the bot to work:

1. Python 3.10 or newer (download from python.org)
2. Python dependencies: pyautogui, soundcard, numpy

### Method 1: Manual installation via Command Prompt
Open Command Prompt (Win + R, type cmd) and run the command:

pip install pyautogui soundcard numpy

### Method 2: Automatic installation
Run the install_dependencies.bat file - it will automatically install all required libraries.

### Verification
After installation, launch the bot with:
python nierfishingbot.py

If you encounter errors, make sure Python is installed and added to PATH.
