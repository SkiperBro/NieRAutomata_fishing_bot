## Calibration

The bot needs to be calibrated for your audio system:

1. Make sure Stereo Mix is enabled and set as the default recording device
2. Launch NieRAutomata in windowed mode
3. Stand in a quiet fishing spot in the game and start fishing
4. Click "Calibrate" - the bot will listen to background noise for 5 seconds
5. The threshold will be automatically set to 1.8x the maximum background noise
6. Adjust the sensitivity manually if needed
7. Click "Start" to begin automated fishing and switch to the game window
8. Click "Stop" when you're done

## Tested Locations

- City Ruins - Pond near the Resistance Camp
- Desert Zone - Oil Field

## Troubleshooting

**Bot doesn't detect fish:**
- Make sure Stereo Mix is enabled and working

**No audio detection:**
- Ensure headphones are plugged into the rear audio panel (not front)
- Test Stereo Mix with audio recording software

**False positives:**
- Increase the sensitivity value
- Move to a quieter fishing spot
- Check that music and voices in the game are disabled
